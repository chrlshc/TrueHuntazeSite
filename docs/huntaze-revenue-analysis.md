1. **Recurring Revenue**: Predictable monthly income
2. **High Margins**: 60-75% profit margins at scale
3. **Low Churn**: Creators depend on the platform
4. **Network Effects**: More creators = better AI = more value
5. **Scalable**: Costs don't increase linearly with users

### Exit Strategy Value

#### SaaS Multiples (10-15x annual revenue)
- At 1000 creators: $5.3M ARR
- Valuation: $53-80M
- With 2000 creators: $106-160M valuation

### What This Means for You

1. **First 100 creators**: Building phase, reinvest everything
2. **100-500 creators**: Break-even, start seeing profits
3. **500-1000 creators**: $3-5M annual profit
4. **1000+ creators**: $50M+ exit opportunity

The key is reaching 500 creators to achieve profitability, then scaling to 1000+ for significant wealth creation.
